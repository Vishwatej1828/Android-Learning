                                \t Its AI model aims to convert a simple text command (like \"find a home in my budget\" or \"create a profit and loss statement\") into actual actions carried out by your computer without you having to lift a finger.\n
                                \t Adept has announced $415 million in total funding and is backed by strategic investors like Microsoft and Nvidia. CEO David Luan, a former OpenAI vice president, co-founded the startup\n

        AI-driven defense software and hardware for autonomous operations.\n\n

        <b>What does it do:</b> Defense software and hardware\n
        <b>Funding:</b> $2.8 B\n
        <b>Year Founded:</b> 2017\n
        <b>Headquarters:</b> Costa Mesa, California\n
        <b>From Editor:</b> Unlike traditional defense contractors that focus on hardware, Anduril\'s core product is its \"Lattice\" software, which uses AI to run drones, surveillance cameras, and underwater vessels nearly autonomously.\n
                                \t These vehicles can work in sync to create a single 3D rendering of an entire area, enabling the protection of land borders and military bases.
                                \t Founded by Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, Matt Grimm, and Joe Chen, Anduril has found success as a rare tech company to penetrate the defense sector and has raised $2.8 billion with a valuation of $10 billion.

        <b>What does it do:</b> AI model developer\n
        <b>Funding:</b> $7.7 B\n
        <b>Year Founded:</b> 2020\n
        <b>Headquarters:</b> San Francisco, California\n
        <b>From Editor:</b> Anthropic has emerged as the OpenAI challenger with the most staying power. In June, the $18 billion (valuation) AI company released a large language model that cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei boasts \"outperforms every competitor\" regardless of price.\n
                            \t The model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is already hard at work coding apps and digesting legal documents. But Amodei is most excited about health care. Pfizer and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are early customers, as is DeepScribe, which uses the tool to help doctors organize conversations with patients.\n
                            \t \"As the models get smarter, they\'re going to be increasingly used for the core of the field,\" Amodei says.

                                \t Recently, the company announced an update to warn users if Ray was configured to be accessible on the open internet after security researchers found that hackers had installed crypto-miners on some user\'s AI servers, as Forbes reported.
